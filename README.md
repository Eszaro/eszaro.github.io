My github account is to display my webpage about my cabinet company Builds That Last.
My repository contains all my files and revisions of coding for my website.
I created my github account then went to the + icon and hit the new repository. Then I named it accordingly. Afterwards, I downloaded github desktop. I then went to the + sign on that application then hit clone a repository. I created a new folder and uploaded my website files into the new folder.
