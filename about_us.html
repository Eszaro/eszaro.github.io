<p class="list_body" style="text-align: left"><br>
  My name is Evan Szaro. I am happily married with two sons and two dogs. I was born in New York but moved to Fuquay-Varina during my elementary school years. After graduating from Fuquay-Varina High School, I joined the Marine Corps where I was stationed at Camp Lejeune for four years. During my final year in the Marine Corps, I took a transitional course in carpentry and rediscovered my love for building. Growing up in New York, I lived close to my grandparents. My grandfather and I had a close bond and I ended up following his path in a lot of ways, such as the military and entrepreneurship. When I was younger, we spent our weekends building bird houses and other small projects together. He showed me the creativity and love behind woodworking. After moving to North Carolina, the passion for that faded until I decided to start my own business in 2021.</p>
<h2 class="list_headings" style="text-align: left">About the business </h2>
<p class="list_body" >I started my business because I wanted to give clients a higher quality of work for less using the best materials, tools and a customer centered approach. I enjoy the entire process from meeting with the clients and hearing their vision to the finished result. Since the designs are custom, every client gets a one-of-a-kind project. With several years of experience so far, my love for cabinet making continues to grow into something that I hope to pass onto my two boys one day. My goal for this business is to stay small and family owned to ensure the quality stays high and the focus stays on the customers needs.&nbsp;</p>
